# To Words

## Context and Objectives

Here the goal is to be able to check if a code behaves as expected.

## Specs

We have a program named `toWords` written by another developer. The code takes a sentence as parameter
and returns a list of word.

We want you to add tests for this code and find if it's possible to write at least one test which prove this code is not working as it should be.

Bonus: Fix the code to ensure it works as it should.

## Coverage

You should aim for 100% coverage here.
