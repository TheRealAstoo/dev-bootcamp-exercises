# Bootstraped Videogames

## Context and objectives

At the moment you should have a website with some hand written CSS style. It's time to speed up and ease the process by using Bootstrap to make your App nice and sexy!

## Specs

### VideoGames data

Until now you worked with a reduced amount of information about video games and games platforms. Now it's time to work with more data, just because we want some content to display to our users!

You now have three more scripts in the `package.json` file:
- `db:drop`: Empty your database.
- `db:seed`: Create video games and platforms in the database.
- `db:reset`: Empty the database then create data.

For now you still have your "old" data, it's time to get the new one with:

```bash
yarn db:reset
```

Take some time to look at it so you can present relevant information to users.

### Bootstrap

With the help of the **[Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)**, it's time to add rework the front-end part of your web application!

### Home page

Let's start by creating a home page!

To do so, start by adding the route in the `src/server.ts` file.

Then, create the nunjucks page in the `view` directory and don't forget to use the layout:

```html
<!-- 'views/home.njk' -->
{% extends "layout.njk" %}

{% block content %}
  <!-- Your content goes here -->
{% endblock %}
```

It would be nice to have a [Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/) right?

You should also add a nice banner!

Then, add some buttons to guide your users ðŸ˜‰.

Maybe you'll end up with something like this:

![Home page example](./assets/images/home-page.png)
> To produce this, there are mostly Bootstrap classes and just a litlle bit of CSS for the [background-image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) size and position.

### Catalog pages

When you're done with the homepage, it's time to style the rest of your web application's pages!

For now, start with the `GET` routes:
- `GET platforms/`
- `GET platforms/:id`
- `GET games/`
- `GET games/:id`

You could have something like that in the end:

![Platforms page example](./assets/images/platforms.png)
> `GET platforms/`

![Games page example](./assets/images/games.png)
> `GET games/`
